# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview Of the project:
* In this project , we use Plotly to create an interactive dashboard which is best way to convey data to volunteers and other researchers. In dashboard , we have shown different charts like bar chart, bubble chart and guage chart.
* The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
* The interactive deshboard link is shown here:[Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://miralchangela.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/)
* Technolgies: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Plotly, D3, JSON.

## Results:

1) Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.

2) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3) Create a bubble chart that displays bacteria cultures per sample.

4) Create a guage chart that displays Belly button washing frequency.

5) Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
